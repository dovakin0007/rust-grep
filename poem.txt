to spread it on thick to shoot off my mouth to get it off my chest
     to tell him where
     to get off
to stay put to face the music to cut a shine to go under to sell
     myself short to play
     myself down
to paint the town to fork over to shell out to shoot up to pull a
     fast one to go haywire
     to take a shine to
to be stuck on to glam it up to vamp it up to get her one better to
     eat a little higher
     on the hog
to win out to get away with to go to the spot to make a stake to 
     make a stand to 
     stand for something to stand up for
to snow under to slip up to go for it to take a stab at it to try out
     to go places to play
     up to get back at
to size up to stand off to slop over to be solid with to lose my
     shirt to get myself off
     to get myself off the hook
